Brain functional network analysis using Electroencephalographic (EEG) data and graph theory in long term meditators

Brain is the most vital organ of the human body. It is the organ which controls almost every single action we do, be it thinking, listening, reading, eating, sleeping or even breathing. It controls and coordinates every that thing which make us complete as a human being. Being concise, brain is the most complex yet intelligent organ of the human body. Brain is an arrangement of a vast network of billions of neurons supported by even multiplied number of glial cells. Bunch of neurons collectively bundled to form nuclei or brain region while their axonal processes collect together to be called as nerves. These nerves pass information in the form of electrical impulses i.e. excitation from one neuron to another neuron. Basically our brain forms the “Natural Neural Network”. The study of brain functioning and its networking has been the key interest of many scientists around the world since many years. The studies are conducted by obtaining information from the brain in the form of EEG/ MEG signals or PET/ fMRI scans. The analysis of the EEG data and drawing important conclusions about the Brain’s functional network can be done with the help of Graph Theory and use of Graph Algorithms.
